# The Challenge
We need a webpage that can pull images, and allow the user to “like” and “unlike” their favourite images.


# We'd like a simple to use interface that makes it easy to:
- Fetch data from one of NASA’s APIs and display the resulting images (more details under Technical Requirements)
- Display descriptive data for each image (for example: title, date, description, etc.)
- Like an image
- Unlike an image
